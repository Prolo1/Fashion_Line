## Description

Have you wondered why Illusion never allowed you to save coordinates to a character card in AI/HS2? Me neither ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø so I made this mod. save as many costumes as you want and share them with others w/o needing to Make like 10 different cards üòÖ (Note: The other person needs this mod as well for anything to happen).

## Known Issues

* ~~I have no idea what will go wrong (so far nothing major)~~
* If you load a costume with over 20 accessory slots and use the "Wear Default" button, slots above 20 probably won't be cleared (I probably won't be able to fix this so... good lucküëç)
